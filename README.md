# Metis-Project-4-NLP-and-Clustering

*Project 4 of Metis Data Science Bootcamp.* Problem statement below: 

Use NLP and clustering methods to find patterns in corpora of your choice. 
___
I analyzed all the text from the *Harry Potter* series using tf-idf, sentiment analysis, and LDA to determine how word importance and topics vary during character interactions throughout the series. For the purposes of this project, I define a character "interaction" as the mention of two character names within 50 words of each other (not including "stop-words"). Specifically, I focused on the storyline between the characters of Harry and Snape.
